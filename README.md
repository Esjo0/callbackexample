Simple explanation of call back functions in Javascript. 

## Call Back functions are simply defined as a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed after some operation has been completed. 

## The idea behind using a callback function is to allow the function to be more flexible and customizable by allowing the caller to specify what should be done after the operation is completed.
